## Quick Start

1. **Install Java 17.** orCASHbuddy requires Java 17 or later. You can verify your version by running `java -version` in your terminal.
2. **Download the application.** Grab the latest `orcashbuddy.jar` from your course release or the project's GitHub Releases page and place it in a convenient folder.
3. **Launch the program.** Open a terminal in the folder containing the JAR and run:
   ```bash
   java -jar orcashbuddy.jar
   ```
   Once the program starts, you’ll see a welcome message and the command menu in your terminal window, as shown below.

> **Note:** The application automatically saves your data to a `data` folder. Your expenses and budget will persist between sessions.

## Using This Guide

- **Command keywords** (e.g., `add`, `list`) are **case-insensitive**.
- **Placeholders** in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` are values you should replace with your own data.
- **Optional parameters** are shown in brackets like `[cat/CATEGORY]`. Do not type the brackets themselves.
- **Amounts** must be positive decimal numbers (e.g., `12.50`). Invalid inputs will display an informative error message.
- **Expense indices** are **1-based** and correspond to the numbering shown by the `list` command.

## Features

### Viewing Help: `help`

Displays the command cheat sheet in the terminal.

**Format:** `help`

Use this whenever you need a quick reminder of the supported commands and their prefixes.

---

### Adding an Expense: `add`

Creates a new expense entry with an amount, description, and optional category.

**Format:** `add a/AMOUNT desc/DESCRIPTION [cat/CATEGORY]`

**Parameters:**
- `AMOUNT` — Positive number up to two decimal places (e.g., `12.50`).
- `DESCRIPTION` — Short sentence describing the expense.
- `CATEGORY` (optional) — Tag to group similar expenses. It must start with a letter and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or hyphens (maximum 20 characters). If omitted, the category defaults to `Uncategorized`.

**Examples:**
```
`add a/4.50 desc/Morning coffee`
```
```
`add a/32.90 desc/Weekly groceries cat/Household`
```

The newly added expense appears as `[ ] [CATEGORY] DESCRIPTION - $AMOUNT`. The `[ ]` will switch to `[X]` once the expense is marked as paid.

---

### Editing an Expense: `edit`
Edit the amount and/or the description and/or the category of an expense. Updates the expense list and recalculates the remaining budget.

**Format:** `edit id/INDEX [a/AMOUNT] [desc/DESCRIPTION] [cat/CATEGORY]`

**Parameters:**
- `INDEX` — Positive integer index of the expense in the list.
- `AMOUNT` (optional) — Positive number up to two decimal places (e.g., `12.50`).
- `DESCRIPTION` (optional) — Short sentence describing the expense.
- `CATEGORY` (optional) — It must start with a letter and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or hyphens (maximum 20 characters).

**Notes:**
- You can change multiple attributes of the expense at once.

**Example:** 
```
edit id/1 a/25 desc/pizza
```

---

### Setting a Budget: `setbudget`

Defines your total spending budget for expense tracking and alerts.

**Format:** `setbudget a/AMOUNT`

**Parameters:**
- `AMOUNT` — Your total budget as a positive number

**Example:**
```
setbudget a/500
```

**Expected output:**
```
---------------------------------------------------------------
Your total budget is now $500.00.
---------------------------------------------------------------
```

**What it does:**
- Sets or updates your monthly/weekly budget
- Enables budget tracking in the `list` command
- Triggers alerts when spending approaches or exceeds the budget:
    - **Near threshold:** When remaining balance falls below $10.00
    - **Equal:** When you've used exactly your budget
    - **Exceeded:** When spending goes over budget

**Notes:**
- Setting a new budget **overwrites** the previous value
- The remaining balance recalculates automatically when expenses are marked/unmarked
- Only **marked** expenses count toward your budget usage

---

### Listing Expenses and Summary: `list`
Shows your current budget, total paid expenses, remaining balance, and every recorded expense in the order added.

**Format:** `list`

If you have no expenses yet, orCASHbuddy tells you so and suggests adding one with the `add` command.

---

### Marking an Expense as Paid: `mark`
Flags an expense as settled. Marked expenses contribute to the “total expenses” value displayed by `list`.

**Format:** `mark INDEX`

**Example:**

```
mark 2
```

The index refers to the numbering shown by the most recent `list`. Once marked, the display changes to `[X] [CATEGORY] DESCRIPTION - $AMOUNT`, and the amount counts toward your budget usage.

---

### Unmarking an Expense: `unmark`
Reverts a previously marked expense to unpaid, increasing your remaining balance accordingly.

**Format:** `unmark INDEX`

**Example:** 

```
unmark 2
```

---

### Finding an Expense: `find`
Searches for expenses by category or description keyword, displaying all matching results.

**Format:** `find cat/CATEGORY` or `find desc/DESCRIPTION`

**Examples:**
```
find cat/food
```
- Finds all expenses with categories containing "food"

```
find desc/lunch
```
- Finds all expenses with descriptions containing "lunch"

If no matches are found, orCASHbuddy displays "No expenses found matching [category/description]: [search term]".

**Note:** The numbering in search results (1, 2, 3...) is for display only and does not correspond to the indices used by `mark`, `unmark`, or `delete` commands. Always use `list` to verify the correct index before modifying expenses.

---

### Sorting Expenses by Amount: `sort`
Displays all expenses in descending order of amount (largest first). Sorting does not change the original order used by other commands.

**Format:** `sort`

If there are no expenses to sort, orCASHbuddy will remind you that there are no expenses added yet.

---

### Deleting an Expense: `delete`
Removes an expense permanently (there is no undo). The application rebalances your budget totals automatically.

**Format:** `delete INDEX`

**Example:** 

```
delete 1
```

After deletion, use `list` to confirm the remaining expenses and updated totals.

---

### Exiting the Application: `bye`
Closes orCASHbuddy gracefully.

**Format:** `bye`

You can also terminate the program by closing the terminal window, but using `bye` ensures the farewell message is displayed.

---

### Saving and Loading Data

**Automatic Saving:**
- The application saves your data automatically after every command
- Data is stored in a `data` folder as `appdata.ser`
- You never need to manually save

**Automatic Loading:**
- When you start orCASHbuddy, it automatically loads your previous session
- If no saved data exists, you start with an empty expense list and zero budget

**Data Location:**
- The `data` folder is created in the same directory as `orcashbuddy.jar`
- Do not manually edit or delete `appdata.ser` unless you want to reset all data

**What's Saved:**
- All expenses (amount, description, category, marked/unmarked status)
- Your current budget
- Total expenses and remaining balance

**Notes:**
- If the save file is corrupted or incompatible, you'll start with a fresh session
- The application will notify you if there are any issues loading data

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I mistype a command?**

**A:** orCASHbuddy prints a helpful error message explaining what went wrong (e.g., "Missing prefix 'a/'" or "Amount must be positive"). Read the error, check the command format in the `help` menu, and try again.

---

**Q: Why don't the numbers in `find` results match my list indices?**

**A:** The `find` and `sort` commands renumber results (1, 2, 3...) for easier reading. These numbers are **display-only** and do not correspond to the actual indices used by `mark`, `unmark`, `edit`, or `delete`. Always use `list` first to verify the correct index before modifying expenses.

---

**Q: Can I have multiple expenses with the same description or category?**

**A:** Yes! orCASHbuddy supports duplicate descriptions and categories. Each expense is tracked independently by its position in the list.

---

**Q: What happens if I mark an expense that's already marked?**

**A:** Nothing changes. The expense remains marked, and the command has no effect. The same applies to unmarking an already unmarked expense.

---

**Q: Does deleting an expense change the indices of other expenses?**

**A:** Yes. When you delete an expense, all expenses below it shift up by one position. Always check the current indices with `list` before performing multiple deletions.

---

**Q: What if my remaining balance is negative?**

**A:** orCASHbuddy allows negative balances and will display them as such (e.g., "Remaining balance: $-45.30"). You'll also see a red alert message indicating you've exceeded your budget, along with how much you're over.

---

**Q: Can I change my budget after setting it?**

**A:** Yes! Simply use the `setbudget` command again with a new amount. The new budget overwrites the old one, and your remaining balance is recalculated based on your current marked expenses.

---

**Q: Where is my data stored?**

**A:** Your data is saved in a file called `appdata.ser` inside a `data` folder, located in the same directory as `orcashbuddy.jar`. This file is automatically created when you first add an expense or set a budget.

---

**Q: Do unmarked expenses count toward my budget?**

**A:** No. Only **marked** expenses (shown with `[X]`) count toward your total expenses and affect your remaining balance. Unmarked expenses (shown with `[ ]`) are tracked but don't impact your budget calculations.
