## Introduction

orCASHbuddy is a Java 17 command-line application that helps students track expenses against a lightweight budget without the overhead of spreadsheets. 

## Setting Up

Follow these steps to set up the project in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. Ensure Java 17 is installed and configured as an IntelliJ SDK.
2. Clone the repository and open it as a **Gradle** project.
3. Let Gradle finish downloading dependencies. The main entry point is `seedu.orcashbuddy.Main`.
4. Run `Main#main` once to verify that the welcome banner appears in the Run tool window.
5. Execute `./gradlew test` (or `gradlew.bat test` on Windows) to confirm all JUnit tests pass.

## Design

### UI Component

### Logic Component

Namespace: `seedu.orcashbuddy.parser`, `seedu.orcashbuddy.command`

- `Parser` tokenises raw user input, relying on prefix-based arguments (e.g., `a/`, `desc/`, `cat/`).
- Validation is handled by `InputValidator`, keeping the parser lean.
- Each `Command` subclass overrides `execute(ExpenseManager, Ui)` and may throw `OrCashBuddyException` for recoverable errors. Commands signal program termination by overriding `isExit()`.

Sequence for the `add` command (see `docs/diagrams/add-sequence.puml`; render with the same command as above):

1. `Main` receives user input and calls `Parser#parse`.
2. `Parser` uses `ArgumentParser` to extract the amount, description, and category from the raw input.
3. `InputValidator` is then used to validate the extracted values.
4. `Parser` returns a new `AddCommand` populated with the validated parameters.
5. `Main` invokes `AddCommand#execute`, which persists the `Expense` via `ExpenseManager` and renders feedback through `Ui`.

### Model Component

Namespace: `seedu.orcashbuddy.expense`, `seedu.orcashbuddy.storage`

- `Expense` is an immutable data carrier (amount, description, category, paid state).
- `ExpenseManager` tracks aggregate figures (`budget`, `totalExpenses`, `remainingBalance`) and exposes behaviors consumed by commands (add, delete, mark/unmark, sort).
- There is no persistent storage in v1.0; all data lives in memory until the process exits.

## Implementation

### Add Expense Feature

#### Overview

The add-expense workflow transforms a single line of user input into a populated `Expense` object, updates the in-memory ledger, and provides immediate feedback in the console. We chose a prefix-based syntax (`add a/AMOUNT desc/DESCRIPTION [cat/CATEGORY]`).

#### Control Flow

1. **Input capture:** `Main` reads the raw line and forwards it to `Parser`.
2. **Tokenisation:** `Parser` uses `ArgumentParser` to extract the amount, description, and category from the raw input. Required prefixes (`a/`, `desc/`) trigger `OrCashBuddyException` if missing, ensuring we fail fast.
3. **Validation:** `InputValidator` is then used to validate the extracted values. It converts the amount into a double (rejecting non-positive or malformed numbers), trims the description, and normalises the optional category. Categories must start with an alphabetic character and may include spaces or hyphens; invalid values raise explicit exceptions so `Ui` can present informative error messages.
4. **Command creation:** A new `AddCommand` instance is constructed with the validated primitives. All downstream logic remains immutable; there is no shared mutable state between parser and command.
5. **Execution:** `AddCommand#execute` wraps the primitives into an `Expense`, calls `ExpenseManager#addExpense`, and then defers to `Ui#showNewExpense`.

The sequence diagram in `docs/diagrams/add-sequence.puml` illustrates the interactions between these collaborative components. Rendering the diagram (e.g., `plantuml docs/diagrams/add-sequence.puml`) is recommended when onboarding new contributors.

#### State Mutation and Invariants

`ExpenseManager#addExpense` enforces a set of assertions: the amount must remain positive, the description non-blank, and the category non-empty. Although assertions are disabled at runtime by default, they serve as guardrails during development and test execution (`./gradlew test` runs with `-ea`). The manager appends the expense to an `ArrayList`, deliberately avoiding sorting or filtering to preserve insertion order for index-based commands.

The `Expense` object itself is largely immutable—only the paid flag can change post-construction. We considered using a builder but opted for a simple constructor to keep object creation lightweight. Formatting logic (`Expense#formatForDisplay`) centralises the "[`[X] [CATEGORY] DESCRIPTION - $AMOUNT`]" representation so that both `Ui` and tests stay in sync.

#### Logging and Diagnostics

`AddCommand` records a structured log entry (`amount`, `description`, `category`) at INFO level. Logs are useful when validating manual test transcripts or diagnosing corrupted input. Since categories may contain spaces, logging at command level avoids the need to recompute arguments later.

#### Error Handling Strategy

During parsing, `OrCashBuddyException`s raised by `InputValidator` are caught inside `Parser` and wrapped in an `InvalidCommand`, ensuring `Ui` can display contextual usage guidance without unwinding the call stack. Exceptions that arise later during command execution (for example, index errors in `DeleteCommand`) do propagate back to `Main`, which logs the issue and keeps the loop responsive. Because `AddCommand` performs no catch-all handling, unexpected runtime problems still surface promptly during testing.

#### Extensibility and Future Enhancements

- **Additional prefixes:** Introducing new metadata (e.g., `date/`, `repeat/`) requires changes only in `Parser`, `InputValidator`, and `Expense`—the command execution logic remains untouched.
- **Persistence:** When a storage layer is added, `ExpenseManager#addExpense` becomes the natural integration point for writing to disk while preserving existing interactions.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Positional arguments:** Rejected because optional fields would force users to remember ordering, increasing input errors.
- **Validation inside `AddCommand`:** We deliberately kept parsing and validation upstream; performing both in the command would dilute separation of concerns and complicate error messaging.

### Mark/Unmark Expense Feature

#### Overview

The mark/unmark workflow allows users to track which expenses have been paid, automatically updating budget calculations and providing immediate visual feedback. Users interact with expenses via one-based indices from the `list` command output. We chose simple index-based syntax (`mark EXPENSE_INDEX` and `unmark EXPENSE_INDEX`) to minimize typing and cognitive load during rapid expense management sessions.

Marking an expense triggers three critical updates: the expense's internal paid state flips to true, the `ExpenseManager` increments `totalExpenses` by the expense amount, and `remainingBalance` is recalculated. Unmarking reverses these operations, decrementing totals and restoring the balance. This design ensures budget tracking remains accurate and responsive to real-world payment workflows.

#### Control Flow

1. **Input capture:** `Main` reads the raw command line and forwards it to `Parser`.
2. **Tokenisation and validation:** `Parser` extracts the index argument and delegates to `InputValidator#validateIndex`. The validator enforces that the index is a positive integer, throwing `OrCashBuddyException` if the input is malformed, missing, or less than 1. This fail-fast approach prevents downstream logic from handling invalid data.
3. **Command creation:** `Parser` constructs either a `MarkCommand` or `UnmarkCommand` with the validated index. The command object remains lightweight as it stores only the integer index, avoiding premature expense lookups.
4. **Execution:** `Main` invokes `command.execute(expenseManager, ui)`:
    - The command calls `ExpenseManager#markExpense(index)` or `unmarkExpense(index)`.
    - `ExpenseManager` first validates the index against the current expense list size via `validateIndex`, which throws `OrCashBuddyException` if the list is empty or the index is out of range.
    - After validation, the manager retrieves the expense at position `index - 1` (converting from 1-based to 0-based indexing).
    - The manager checks if the expense is already in the desired state (marked/unmarked) to avoid redundant operations.
    - If state change is needed, the manager calls `Expense#mark()` or `unmark()` to flip the boolean flag.
    - For marking: `updateBudgetAfterMark(expense)` is called, which adds the expense amount to `totalExpenses` and invokes `recalculateRemainingBalance()`.
    - For unmarking: `updateBudgetAfterUnmark(expense)` is called, which subtracts the expense amount from `totalExpenses` and invokes `recalculateRemainingBalance()`.
    - The manager returns the modified `Expense` object to the command.
    - The command passes the expense to `Ui#showMarkedExpense` or `showUnmarkedExpense`, which displays the confirmation with the updated visual status (`[X]` for marked, `[ ]` for unmarked).
    - Finally, `ExpenseManager#determineBudgetStatus()` is invoked to evaluate if budget alerts should fire based on the new remaining balance. If status is not `OK`, the command calls `Ui#showBudgetStatus` with the status and remaining balance.
5. **Data persistence:** `Main` calls `StorageManager.saveExpenseManager(expenseManager, ui)` after command execution to persist the updated state to disk.

The sequence diagram in `docs/diagrams/mark-sequence.puml` illustrates these interactions. A corresponding `unmark-sequence.puml` captures the symmetrical unmark flow with budget decrements instead of increments.

#### State Mutation and Invariants

The `Expense` class maintains a mutable `isMarked` boolean flag, initially set to `false` in the constructor. This is the only mutable field in an otherwise immutable object. The `mark()` and `unmark()` methods provide controlled mutation:

```java
public void mark() {
    this.isMarked = true;
}

public void unmark() {
    this.isMarked = false;
}
```

`ExpenseManager` enforces several critical invariants during mark/unmark operations:

- **Index bounds:** Assertions verify `index >= 1` before calling manager methods. The `validateIndex` method throws exceptions for indices outside `[1, expenses.size()]` or when the list is empty.
- **Budget consistency:** After any mark/unmark, the invariant `remainingBalance == budget - totalExpenses` must hold. This is enforced through `recalculateRemainingBalance`, which is called by both `updateBudgetAfterMark` and `updateBudgetAfterUnmark`.
- **Non-negative totals:** While not explicitly asserted in production code, the design ensures `totalExpenses >= 0.0` through careful decrement logic during unmarking.

These invariants are verified during development testing (when assertions are enabled with `-ea`) and logged at INFO level, making it easy to diagnose state corruption during manual testing or debugging.

#### Budget Status Integration

After marking or unmarking an expense, `ExpenseManager#determineBudgetStatus()` evaluates the new `remainingBalance` against predefined thresholds and returns a `BudgetStatus` enum:

- **`EXCEEDED` (`remainingBalance < 0`):** Budget has been exceeded.
- **`EQUAL` (`remainingBalance == 0`):** Budget has been fully used.
- **`NEAR` (`remainingBalance < $10.00`):** Remaining balance is below warning threshold.
- **`OK`:** Sufficient budget remains.

If the status is not `OK`, the command invokes `Ui#showBudgetStatus(status, remainingBalance)`, which displays contextual alerts.

This immediate feedback loop helps users make informed spending decisions right after recording payments, rather than requiring a separate `list` command to check status.

#### Logging and Diagnostics

Both `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand` log structured entries at INFO level:

```java
LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Marked expense at index {0}: {1}",
        new Object[]{index, expense.getDescription()});

LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Unmarked expense at index {0}: {1}",
        new Object[]{index, expense.getDescription()});
```

`ExpenseManager` logs budget updates after each operation:

```java
LOGGER.info(() -> "Updated budget after mark: total=" + totalExpenses +
        ", remaining=" + remainingBalance);

LOGGER.info(() -> "Updated budget after unmark: total=" + totalExpenses +
        ", remaining=" + remainingBalance);
```

These logs are essential for verifying correct budget arithmetic during manual testing and provide audit trails for debugging user-reported discrepancies.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Automatic marking on add:** Some expense trackers assume all added expenses are immediately paid. We rejected this because our target users (students managing interest group budgets) often log planned expenses, recurring bills, or shared costs before payment occurs. Explicit marking preserves flexibility for diverse workflows.
- **Visual indicators in list:** Instead of `[X]`/`[ ]` markers, we explored color coding (green for paid, red for unpaid) or emoji indicators (✓/✗). Rejected because:
    - ANSI colors may not render consistently across all terminals.
    - Emoji require Unicode support and increase display width.
    - Bracket notation is text-based, universally compatible, and familiar to users from todo list applications (including the CS2113 iP assignment).

### Find Expense Feature

#### Overview

The find workflow enables users to quickly locate expenses by searching either category or description fields, returning all matching results in a filtered view. Users specify search criteria via prefix-based syntax (`find cat/CATEGORY` or `find desc/DESCRIPTION`), maintaining consistency with other commands in the application. We chose separate prefix-based searches over a unified keyword approach to give users precise control: category searches target organizational labels while description searches hunt for specific transaction details.

The find operation performs case-insensitive substring matching, prioritizing ease of use over exact matching. A search for `cat/food` will match expenses categorized as "Food", "Fast Food", or "Seafood". This approach reduces the cognitive burden of remembering exact category names or descriptions, particularly useful when users manage dozens of expenses across multiple categories. The search is read-only and does not modify any data, making it safe to use exploratively without risk of accidental changes.

#### Control Flow

1. **Input capture:** `Main` reads the raw command line (`find cat/groceries` or `find desc/lunch`) and forwards it to `Parser`.

2. **Tokenisation and validation:** `Parser` uses `ArgumentParser` to extract optional category and description values:
    - `ArgumentParser#getOptionalValue("cat/")` returns the category string if present, otherwise `null`.
    - `ArgumentParser#getOptionalValue("desc/")` returns the description keyword if present, otherwise `null`.
    - The parser checks category first: if a non-empty category is found, it constructs a category-based `FindCommand`.
    - If no category is present but a non-empty description exists, it constructs a description-based `FindCommand`.
    - If both prefixes are absent or contain only whitespace, `Parser` throws `OrCashBuddyException` with message "Missing search criteria for 'find' command".

3. **Command creation:** `Parser` constructs a `FindCommand` with two string parameters:
    - `searchType`: either `"category"` or `"description"` to indicate the search mode.
    - `searchTerm`: the trimmed search string extracted from the user input.
    - The command stores these as immutable fields, deferring actual search logic to execution time.

4. **Execution:** `Main` invokes `command.execute(expenseManager, ui)`:
    - The command asserts that both `searchType` and `searchTerm` are non-blank, catching any parser violations during development (when assertions are enabled with `-ea`).
    - The command logs the search operation at INFO level: `"Executing find command: type={searchType}, term={searchTerm}"`.
    - Based on `searchType`, the command calls either:
        - `ExpenseManager#findExpensesByCategory(searchTerm)` for category searches
        - `ExpenseManager#findExpensesByDescription(searchTerm)` for description searches
    - Both manager methods perform case-insensitive substring matching:
        - Validate that the search term is non-blank (throws `IllegalArgumentException` if violated, though this should be caught earlier by parser).
        - Convert the search term to lowercase and trim whitespace: `String searchTerm = keyword.toLowerCase().trim()`.
        - Iterate through the `expenses` list using an enhanced for loop.
        - For each expense, retrieve the target field (category or description) and convert it to lowercase.
        - Check if the field contains the search term as a substring using `String#contains`.
        - Accumulate matching expenses in a new `ArrayList<Expense>`.
    - The manager logs the result count at INFO level: `"Found {count} expenses matching {type}: {term}"`.
    - The manager returns the results list to the command.
    - The command logs the result count: `"Found {count} matching expenses"`.
    - The command passes the results list, search term, and search type to `Ui#showFoundExpenses`, which formats and displays the output.

5. **Data persistence:** Since find is a read-only operation, `StorageManager.saveExpenseManager` is called after execution (as per the standard command execution flow in `Main`), but no actual data changes occur.

The sequence diagram in `docs/diagrams/find-sequence.puml` illustrates these interactions, showing the branching logic for category versus description searches within `ExpenseManager`.

#### Search Algorithm and Performance

Both `findExpensesByCategory` and `findExpensesByDescription` use linear search with substring matching:

```java
public List<Expense> findExpensesByCategory(String category) {
    validateSearchTerm(category, "Category");
    
    String searchTerm = category.toLowerCase().trim();
    List<Expense> foundExpenses = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (Expense expense : expenses) {
        if (expense.getCategory().toLowerCase().contains(searchTerm)) {
            foundExpenses.add(expense);
        }
    }
    
    LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Found {0} expenses matching category: {1}",
            new Object[]{foundExpenses.size(), category});
    
    return foundExpenses;
}
```

**Case insensitivity:** Achieved via `toLowerCase()` on both the expense field and search term. This adds minimal overhead (single-pass string conversion) compared to case-sensitive matching and significantly improves user experience because users need not remember exact capitalization from previous entries.
**Substring matching rationale:** We chose `contains()` over `equals()` or `startsWith()` because:
- Users often remember partial keywords (e.g., "lunch" from "Team lunch meeting").
- Exact matching would frustrate users who mistype or abbreviate categories.
- StartsWith would miss mid-string matches like "Fast Food" when searching for "food".

#### Display Format and User Feedback

`Ui#showFoundExpenses` handles three scenarios:

1. **No matches found:** Displays `"No expenses found matching {searchType}: {searchTerm}"`, helping users distinguish between empty expense lists and unsuccessful searches.

2. **One or more matches:** Shows count first (`"Found {count} expense(s) matching {searchType}: {searchTerm}"`), followed by a numbered list of matching expenses formatted via `Expense#formatForDisplay`. The numbering (1, 2, 3...) is display-only and does not correspond to original list indices: this prevents confusion since find results are a filtered subset.

3. **Separator formatting:** The output is wrapped in separator lines for visual clarity, consistent with other command outputs.

Example output for `find cat/food`:
```
---------------------------------------------------------------
Found 2 expense(s) matching category: food
1. [ ] [Food] Lunch - $8.50
2. [X] [Fast Food] Dinner - $12.00
---------------------------------------------------------------
```

Users can visually scan the marked status (`[X]`/`[ ]`) within results, supporting workflows where they want to find unpaid expenses in a specific category or locate specific transactions by description keywords.

#### Logging and Diagnostics

`FindCommand` logs at INFO level before and after search execution:

```java
LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Executing find command: type={0}, term={1}",
        new Object[]{searchType, searchTerm});

LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Found {0} matching expenses", foundExpenses.size());
```

`ExpenseManager` search methods also log results:

```java
LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Found {0} expenses matching category: {1}",
        new Object[]{foundExpenses.size(), category});

LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Found {0} expenses matching description: {1}",
        new Object[]{foundExpenses.size(), keyword});
```

These logs help verify search accuracy during manual testing and provide debugging context when users report unexpected results. Since searches are read-only operations, logging includes only counts and search terms, not full expense details, to keep log files manageable and avoid sensitive data exposure.

Example log sequence for `find cat/food`:
```
INFO: Executing find command: type=category, term=food
INFO: Found 2 expenses matching category: food
INFO: Found 2 matching expenses
```

#### Design Rationale

**Why separate category and description searches?**  
Alternatives included a unified search that checks both fields simultaneously or allowing combined searches (`find cat/food desc/lunch`). We chose mutually exclusive searches because:
- Users typically know whether they're hunting by category or description.
- Separate searches produce more predictable results: unified searches would mix matches, complicating result interpretation.
- Command syntax remains simple, with only one prefix required per invocation.

**Why case-insensitive matching?**  
Case-sensitive matching was rejected because:
- Users rarely remember exact capitalization from previous entries.
- Mixed-case categories (e.g., "FastFood" vs "fastfood" vs "Fast Food") are common in real-world data entry.
- The performance cost of `toLowerCase()` is negligible for our target dataset size.

#### Extensibility and Future Enhancements

- **Combined searches:** Introducing `find cat/food desc/lunch` would require collecting both category and description matches, intersecting the results, then displaying only expenses matching both criteria. This needs parser changes to allow multiple optional prefixes simultaneously.
- **Date-based searches:** Future versions with date tracking could support `find date/2024-01-15` or `find date/last-week`, requiring new fields in `Expense` and corresponding manager methods.
- **Amount range searches:** Queries like `find a/10-50` to locate expenses within price bands would complement category/description searches for budget analysis workflows.
- **Search result actions:** A `mark-found` or `delete-found` command could batch-operate on search results, though this introduces complexity in confirming user intent before bulk modifications.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Search result caching:** We considered storing the last search results in `ExpenseManager` to support pagination or follow-up operations. Rejected because it introduces statefulness that complicates testing and doesn't align with the stateless command model used elsewhere.
- **Multi-field unified search:** A single `search KEYWORD` command that checks all fields (category, description, amount) was considered but rejected because amount matching requires different logic (numerical comparison vs string matching), and unified results would be harder to interpret.

### Delete Expense Feature

#### Overview

The delete workflow enables users to remove unwanted or incorrect expense entries from the list permanently. Users specify the expense to delete using its index in the displayed list (`delete INDEX`), maintaining consistency with other index-based commands such as `mark` and `unmark`. 
The command updates the stored data automatically, ensuring that the deleted expense no longer appears after restarting the application.
Deletion is an irreversible operation, once an expense is deleted, it cannot be recovered. However, we designed the workflow to be deliberate and safe by requiring explicit index input and validating that the list is not empty before proceeding. 
This prevents accidental deletions and ensures data integrity.

#### Control Flow

1. **Input capture:** `Main` reads the user's command (`delete 3`) and passes it to `Parser`.
2. **Tokenisation and validation:** `Parser` extracts the index argument using a helper validator method:
    - `InputValidator.validateIndex(arguments, "delete")` ensures the index is a positive integer within list bounds.
    - If validation fails, an `OrCashBuddyException` is thrown with an appropriate error message (e.g., "Invalid index: 5. There are only 3 expenses.").
3. **Command creation:** `Parser` constructs a new `DeleteCommand` object and stores the parsed index for later execution.
4. **Execution:** When `Main` invokes `command.execute(expenseManager, ui)`:
    - The command calls `ExpenseManager#deleteExpense(index)` to remove the targeted expense.
    - If the expense was marked as paid, the manager automatically updates total expenses and remaining balance.
    - The deleted expense is passed to `Ui#showDeletedExpense` for user feedback.
    - Data persistence is triggered by the main application logic after command execution, ensuring consistency without coupling storage logic into `ExpenseManager`.

The sequence diagram in `docs/diagrams/delete-sequence.puml` illustrates these interactions from input parsing to UI display.

#### Deletion Logic and Validation

`ExpenseManager#deleteExpense(int index)` performs several key steps:

```java
public Expense deleteExpense(int index) throws OrCashBuddyException {
    validateIndex(index);
    Expense removedExpense = expenses.remove(index - 1);

    if (removedExpense.isMarked()) {
        totalExpenses -= removedExpense.getAmount();
        recalculateRemainingBalance();
    }

    LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "Deleted expense at index {0}: {1}",
               new Object[]{index, removedExpense.getDescription()});
    return removedExpense;
}
```

##### Validation
- The index must be within range and the list cannot be empty.
- `validateIndex()` throws `OrCashBuddyException` if conditions are not met.

##### Balance update
If the deleted expense was marked, the total expenses and remaining balance are recalculated to reflect the deletion.

#### Display Format and User Feedback

`Ui#showDeletedExpense` displays feedback confirming successful deletion:

```java
public void showDeletedExpense(Expense expense) {
    System.out.println("Deleted Expense:");
    System.out.println(expense.formatForDisplay());
}
```

Example output:

```
Deleted Expense:
[X] [] Lunch - $8.50
```

This clear visual confirmation reassures users that the intended expense was deleted. The display includes the expense's previous marked status and category, maintaining consistency with other output formats.

#### Logging and Diagnostics

The `DeleteCommand` and `ExpenseManager` log relevant details at INFO level to aid debugging:

```
Executing delete command for index: 3
Deleted expense at index 3: Lunch
```
If an invalid index is entered or the expense list is empty, an OrCashBuddyException is thrown to signal the error.
If an invalid index is entered or the expense list is empty, a warning-level log is generated:

```
WARNING: Invalid index 5. No expense deleted.
```

These logs help trace command execution and identify user input errors during testing.

#### Design Rationale

##### Why index-based deletion?
We chose index-based deletion instead of name-based deletion to:

- Keep command syntax concise and consistent with other list-based commands.
- Avoid ambiguity when multiple expenses share the same category or description.
- Ensure predictable behaviour regardless of duplicate entries.

##### Why immediate data persistence?
Deleting an expense instantly updates the stored file, ensuring users never lose consistency between sessions. This design choice eliminates the need for manual saving commands.

#### Extensibility and Future Enhancements

- **Multiple deletions:** Extend syntax to `delete 2 4 5` to allow batch deletions. This requires modifying the parser to handle multiple indices and iteratively remove them in descending order.
- **Soft delete / undo:** Instead of permanently deleting, expenses could be flagged as "archived" for recovery later. An `undo` or `restore` command could then reinsert them.
- **Delete by search result:** Allow deleting directly from filtered lists (e.g., after `find cat/food`). This would require context tracking of last search results within `ExpenseManager`.

#### Alternatives Considered

##### Confirmation prompt before delete
Considered adding a confirmation step (Are you sure? y/n) to prevent accidental deletions. Rejected because it slows down CLI usage and contradicts the lightweight command design philosophy.

##### Name-based deletion
Rejected due to ambiguity when duplicate names exist. Index-based deletion remains deterministic and simpler to implement.

##### Deferred deletion
We considered queuing deletions and saving all at exit. Rejected in favor of immediate persistence for reliability and simplicity.


### Edit Expense Feature

#### Overview

The **Edit Expense** feature allows users to modify details of an existing expense, such as the amount, description, or category, without deleting and re-adding it. This makes it easier for users to correct mistakes or update expense information while keeping accurate totals.

#### Implementation
The `EditCommand` class extends `Command` and performs the update by replacing the specified `Expense` with a new `Expense` object containing the modified details.
#### Control Flow

1. **Input Capture:**  
   `Main` reads the user's command (`edit`) along with any provided parameters and forwards it to `Parser`.

2. **Input parsing and Command Creation:**  
   The user inputs an edit command in the form:
   ```
   edit /id<index> /a<amount> /desc<description> /cat<category>
   ```
   The parser, recognizes the `edit` keyword, extracts the provided parameters and constructs an `EditCommand` object.
   - Attributes `newAmount`, `newDescription`, and `newCategory` store the values provided by the user.
   - If the user omits any parameter, the corresponding attribute remains `null`, indicating no change for that field.

3. **Execution:**  
   The existing expense is replaced with a new `Expense` instance containing updated fields. Only the provided fields are changed — unspecified fields remain the same.

   When `Main` invokes `command.execute(expenseManager, ui)`:
   - The command retrieves the original expense via `ExpenseManager#getExpense(index)`, capturing its amount, description, category, and marked status.
   - For each editable field, the command determines the new value: if the user provided an update, it uses that; otherwise, it retains the original value.
   - A new `Expense` object `edited` is constructed with the updated parameters.
   - The command calls `ExpenseManager#replaceExpense(index, edited)` to replace the original expense in the list.
   - If the original expense was marked, `ExpenseManager#markExpense(index)` is invoked to preserve the marked state.

4. **UI Feedback:**
   - The updated expense is displayed to the user via `Ui#showEditedExpense`.
   - `ExpenseManager#checkRemainingBalance(ui)` is called to recalculate the budget and display alerts if thresholds are exceeded.

5. **Data Persistence:**  
   `StorageManager#saveExpenseManager` is invoked to immediately persist the updated expense list to disk, ensuring no data is lost.

The sequence diagram in `docs/diagrams/edit-sequence.puml` illustrates the interactions between `Main`, `Parser`, `EditCommand`, `ExpenseManager`, `Ui`, and `StorageManager` during this workflow.


#### Validation
- Ensures the provided index corresponds to an existing expense.
- Null values for fields (amount/description/category) preserve the original data, allowing partial edits.
- Invalid or negative amounts trigger validation errors from `InputValidator`.

#### Example

##### User Input
```
edit /id 2 /a 20.50 /desc Dinner /cat Food
```

##### Expected Output
```
Edited expense: [ ] [Food] Dinner - $20.50
```

#### Logging and Diagnostics

Logging statements in both `EditCommand` and `ExpenseManager` track the feature’s lifecycle:

```
INFO: Executing EditCommand for index 2
INFO: Updated expense: [ ] [Food] Brunch - $15.00
INFO: EditCommand execution completed
```

If validation fails:
```
WARNING: Attempted to edit expense with invalid index 7
```

These logs assist in debugging, regression testing, and tracing command history during QA.

#### Design Rationale

##### Why replace instead of mutate?
The `Expense` class uses `final` fields to preserve immutability and data safety.  
Creating a new `Expense` object ensures that once created, an instance cannot be corrupted by later edits.

##### Why allow partial updates?
Users may only want to fix one detail (e.g., typo in description), so optional parameters provide flexibility.



#### Extensibility and Future Enhancements

- **Support editing by keyword:** Allow editing by expense name instead of index (e.g., `edit "Lunch"`).
- **Batch editing:** Enable simultaneous modification of multiple expenses.
- **Undo/redo support:** Integrate with a command history system for reversible edits.


### Sort Expenses Feature

#### Overview

The sort workflow enables users to view all expenses in descending order of amount (`sort`).
This provides an immediate way to identify the largest expenditures and helps users make informed budget decisions. 
The command does not modify the original expense list to preserve insertion order, and it automatically updates the UI to display the sorted list. 
If no expenses exist, the system provides a clear message instead of failing, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

#### Control Flow

1. **Input capture:** `Main` reads the user's command (`sort`) and passes it to `Parser`.
2. **Command creation:** `Parser` recognises the sort keyword and constructs a new `SortCommand` object.
3. **Execution:** When `Main` invokes `command.execute(expenseManager, ui)`:
    - The command calls `ExpenseManager#sortExpenses()` to sort the expenses.
    - The sorted list of expenses is displayed via `Ui#showSortedExpenseList`.
    - If the expense list is empty, `Ui#showEmptyExpenseList()` is invoked instead.
4. **Data persistence:** Sorting does not change the stored data, so no file updates are required.
   However, `StorageManager.saveExpenseManager(expenseManager, ui)` is still after execution, which just saves the existing list of data, not the sorted list.

The sequence diagram in `docs/diagrams/sort-sequence.puml` illustrates these interactions from input parsing to UI display.

#### Sorting Logic and Validation

`ExpenseManager#sortExpenses(Ui ui)` performs the sorting operation:

```java
public void sortExpenses(Ui ui) {
    if (expenses.isEmpty()) {
        ui.showListUsage();
        return;
    }

    ArrayList<Expense> sortedExpenses = new ArrayList<>(expenses);
    sortedExpenses.sort((e1, e2) -> Double.compare(e2.getAmount(), e1.getAmount()));
    ui.showSortedList(sortedExpenses);
}
```

##### Validation
- The method first checks if the expense list is empty.
- No sorting occurs if there are no expenses; a message is displayed instead.

##### Sorting mechanism
- A copy of the expense list is created to preserve the original order.
- Expenses are sorted in descending order by their amount using a comparator.

#### Display Format and User Feedback

`Ui#showSortedList` displays the sorted expenses:

```java
public void showSortedList(ArrayList<Expense> sortedExpenses) {
    System.out.println("Here is the list of sorted expenses, starting with the highest amount:");
    for (int i = 0; i < sortedExpenses.size(); i++) {
        System.out.println((i + 1) + ". " + sortedExpenses.get(i).formatForDisplay());
    }
}
```

Example output:

```
Here is the list of sorted expenses, starting with the highest amount:
1. [X] [] Laptop - $1200.00
2. [ ] [] Groceries - $85.50
3. [ ] [] Lunch - $8.50
```

This format maintains consistency with other list displays while clearly highlighting the largest expenses first.

#### Logging and Diagnostics

The `SortCommand` and `ExpenseManager` log relevant details at INFO level:

```
Executing SortCommand
Sorting expenses in descending order by amount
SortCommand execution completed
```

If the expense list is empty:

```
INFO: Unable to sort expenses as list is empty
```

These logs help trace command execution and identify potential issues during testing.

#### Design Rationale

##### Why a separate sorted copy?
Creating a copy preserves the original list order, allowing other commands like `list` to maintain chronological display.

##### Why descending order?
Descending order quickly highlights the largest expenses, which are typically the most important for budget analysis.

##### Why no data persistence?
Sorting is a view operation only; the stored data should remain unchanged. This ensures sorting is fast and non-destructive.

#### Extensibility and Future Enhancements

- **Alternative sort criteria:** Enable sorting by category, description, or date.
- **Toggle order:** Allow ascending/descending toggle via `sort asc` or `sort desc`.
- **Combined filters:** Sort results after `find` commands for more advanced queries.
- **GUI integration:** Display sorted results in a table with sortable columns for future UI enhancements.

#### Alternatives Considered

##### Sort with data persistence
Rejected since sorting is purely a viewing operation and should not alter stored data.

##### Multi-criteria sorting
Considered (e.g., sort by amount then category), but initially implemented simple descending amount sort to keep the CLI lightweight and intuitive.

### Storage Management Feature

#### Overview

The `StorageManager` handles persistent storage of the application's `ExpenseManager`. 
It serializes the entire object graph to a file and ensures that user data is safely saved and loaded across application sessions. 
All interactions with disk storage are mediated by this class, centralising file I/O, error handling and logging. This is done automatically by the application. 
Users do not have to key in a command to save or load data.

**Key responsibilities:**
* Save `ExpenseManager` to disk (`saveExpenseManager`).
* Load `ExpenseManager` from disk (`loadExpenseManager`).
* Automatically create storage directories and files if missing.
* Handle exceptions gracefully and provide user feedback through `Ui`.
* Log all important events for diagnostics.

#### Storage Location

* **Directory:** `data`
* **File:** `appdata.ser`

This is a binary serialized file using Java's built-in serialization mechanism (`ObjectOutputStream` / `ObjectInputStream`).

#### Control Flow

##### 1. `saveExpenseManager(ExpenseManager expenseManager, Ui ui)`

**Purpose:** Saves the current state of expenses to disk.

**Parameters:**
* `expenseManager`: The current `ExpenseManager` instance to save.
* `ui`: Provides user feedback in case of errors.

**Workflow:**
1. Validate non-null arguments.
2. Ensure the `data` folder exists, create if missing.
3. Serialize `ExpenseManager` into `appdata.ser`.
4. Catch and log any exceptions: `IOException`, `SecurityException`.
5. Provide user-friendly messages for any failure.

**Logging:**
* Success: `INFO: ExpenseManager successfully saved to <path>`
* Failure: `WARNING: Failed to save ExpenseManager`

**Example Usage:**
```java
StorageManager.saveExpenseManager(expenseManager, ui);
```

##### 2. `loadExpenseManager(Ui ui)`

**Purpose:** Loads the `ExpenseManager` from disk or returns a new instance if loading fails.

**Parameters:**
* `ui`: Provides user feedback in case of errors.

**Workflow:**
1. Validate non-null `ui`.
2. Ensure `data` folder exists, create if missing.
3. Ensure `appdata.ser` file exists; create if missing.
4. Deserialize the object using `ObjectInputStream`.
5. Validate that the loaded object is an instance of `ExpenseManager`.
6. Catch exceptions: `IOException`, `ClassNotFoundException`, `SecurityException`.
7. On failure, log the issue and return a new `ExpenseManager`.
8. Provide user-friendly messages for corrupted, incompatible, or missing data.

**Logging:**
* Success: `INFO: ExpenseManager successfully loaded from <path>`
* Failure: `WARNING: IOException / ClassNotFoundException / SecurityException while reading storage file`

**Example Usage:**
```java
ExpenseManager expenseManager = StorageManager.loadExpenseManager(ui);
```
The sequence diagram in `docs/diagrams/storage-manager-sequence.puml` illustrates these interactions.

#### Error Handling

* **Folder/File Creation Failure:** Displayed via `Ui.showError`, logged as `WARNING`.
* **Serialization/Deserialization Failure:** Gracefully fallback to a new `ExpenseManager`.
* **Permission Issues:** Displayed to user; logged as `WARNING`.

All exceptions are caught internally to prevent the application from crashing due to storage issues.

#### Design Rationale

1. **Centralised Storage Handling:** All file operations go through `StorageManager`, keeping I/O logic separate from user interaction.
2. **Immediate Data Saving:** Every command that modifies `ExpenseManager` calls `saveExpenseManager` immediately. This prevents data loss during unexpected shutdowns.
3. **User-Friendly Error Feedback:** By coupling with `Ui`, storage errors are communicated in plain language rather than Java exceptions.
4. **Robustness:** Handles missing directories/files, corrupted data, and permission issues. Never throws unchecked exceptions that crash the app.

#### Extensibility and Future Enhancements

* **Alternative File Formats:** Support JSON or XML for easier inspection and manual editing.
* **Backup Mechanism:** Maintain a versioned backup of previous `ExpenseManager` states.
* **Encryption:** Secure sensitive data by encrypting the serialized file.
* **Incremental Save:** Save only modified parts of `ExpenseManager` instead of the whole object.

#### Logging and Diagnostics

* All storage events are logged at `INFO` for successful operations and `WARNING` for failures.
* Enables tracing of storage-related issues during debugging or testing.

### Graceful Exit

#### Overview

Exiting the application used to depend on `Main` inspecting raw input (checking for `bye`). This tightly coupled the loop to a single keyword and prevented other commands from influencing shutdown behaviour. The redesigned flow delegates responsibility to `ByeCommand`, aligning termination with the rest of the command framework and paving the way for richer exit scenarios (e.g., confirm prompts, autosave).

#### Control Flow

1. **Parsing:** When the user enters `bye`, `Parser` instantly returns a `ByeCommand`. Any trailing arguments result in an `OrCashBuddyException`, protecting against typos such as `bye later`.
2. **Execution:** `Main` calls `command.execute(expenseManager, ui)` without special casing. `ByeCommand` logs a concise INFO message and calls `Ui#showGoodbye`.
3. **Exit signalling:** After execution, `Main` queries `command.isExit()`, which `ByeCommand` overrides to return `true`. Once `Main` receives `true`, the run loop terminates cleanly.

The sequence diagram stored at `docs/diagrams/bye-sequence.puml` captures this flow. Rendering it clarifies that no other component interacts with the exit decision, preserving a single exit pathway.

#### Rationale

- **Testability:** Unit tests can now instantiate `ByeCommand` directly, verifying both the farewell message and the exit flag without running the whole application loop (`ByeCommandTest` demonstrates this).
- **Extensibility:** If we later introduce persistence, `ByeCommand` can flush data stores before returning, while non-exit commands remain unaffected.


#### Alternatives Considered

- **Direct system exit:** Calling `System.exit(0)` inside `ByeCommand` was rejected because it would complicate testing and bypass finally blocks or future shutdown hooks.
- **Flag in Main:** Another option was a mutable boolean toggled inside `Main` after recognising `bye`. This still requires special casing and scatters exit logic.

By keeping farewell handling within the command framework, orCASHbuddy maintains a coherent abstraction and prepares for richer lifecycle management in subsequent releases.

## Appendix C: Non-Functional Requirements
1. The application must run on any system with Java 17 installed (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. Commands should execute within one second for up to 200 stored expenses.
3. The codebase should pass `./gradlew checkstyleMain` with no warnings.
4. The CLI should remain readable on terminals with at least 80 characters width.
5. The project should provide at least 80% branch coverage for command logic tests.

## Appendix D: Glossary

- **Expense Index:** One-based position of an expense in the list output.
- **Paid Expense:** An expense that has been marked as settled using the `mark` command.
- **Uncategorized:** Default category assigned when the user omits the optional `cat/` parameter.

## Appendix E: Instructions for Manual Testing

All tests assume the repository has been cloned and Java 17 is available.

1. **Launch**: Run `./gradlew run` (or `gradlew.bat run`). Confirm the welcome banner and menu appear.
2. **Add Expense**: Enter `add a/4.50 desc/Coffee cat/Drinks`. Expect a “New Expense” confirmation with `[ ] [Drinks] Coffee - $4.50`.
3. **List Expenses**: Enter `list`. Confirm the expense appears and the budget defaults to `$0.00`.
4. **Set Budget**: Enter `setbudget a/50`. Run `list` again to verify the budget and remaining balance display `$50.00`.
5. **Mark Expense**: Enter `mark 1`. `list` should now show `[X] [Drinks]` and total expenses `$4.50` with remaining `$45.50`.
6. **Unmark Expense**: Enter `unmark 1` and verify totals reset to `$0.00` spent.
7. **Find by Category**: Add expenses with categories "Food", "Transport", "Facilities". Execute `find cat/food` and verify "Food" appear as a result.
8. **Find by Description**: Add expenses with descriptions "Lunch meeting" and "Volleyball court". Execute `find desc/lunch` and verify only the first expense appears.
9. **Sort Expenses**: Add two more entries of varying amounts and run `sort`; check that output is descending by amount.
10. **Delete Expense**: Execute `delete 2` (adjust index if needed) and confirm the list shrinks accordingly.
11. **Exit**: Finish with `bye`. Expect a “Bye. Hope to see you again soon!” message, and the application should terminate.
12. **Regression Script**: The Windows batch script `text-ui-test/runtest.bat` (or `text-ui-test/runtest.sh` on macOS/Linux) rebuilds the JAR and exercises the help command. Ensure `EXPECTED.TXT` matches the actual output before committing changes to commands or messages.

When verifying bug fixes or new features, prefer updating both JUnit tests in `src/test/java/seedu/orcashbuddy` and text UI expectations in `text-ui-test` to prevent regressions.
